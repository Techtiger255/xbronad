Based on [DT's config](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/tree/master/.xmonad), however, it's blossomed into much much more.

PLEASE look at [lib/Custom/Keys.hs](https://github.com/Techtiger255/xbronad/blob/master/lib/Custom/Keys.hs) for the keybindings.  
They're simple, but most defaults are overriden -- help messages are strewn about, but it helps to know what they are before diving in.

If you get stuck then a quick way to enter common configs is <kbd>M-\\ ]</kbd>.  
Prefferred programs can be located in Vars.hs.
